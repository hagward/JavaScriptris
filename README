The challenge was: how long time will it take to write a Tetris clone
stranded on a desolate island with only a laptop and an old smartphone,
equipped with a painfully slow and unreliable mobile internet connection and
barely basic JavaScript knowledge? The answer was: two evenings and one
morning.

At first I used a list containing the locked blocks in order to be able to
render them more quickly (in contrast to looping through the 10*16 'grid'
matrix), but maintaining the list when deleting rows showed to be a bit
tricky. I then reckoned that was a completely unnecessary optimization and
saved myself from the headache. The score system is from the original Tetris
but the level system is completely improvised.
